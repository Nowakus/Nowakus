### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Marcin. I am employed by BNL Lab (Long Island, NY) to work on the ATLAS experiment at LHC (near Geneva) as a software specialist.
ATLAS software is open source, but not on GitHub. But one of the important software components that is used by the ATLAS software framework, Athena, is here - ROOT.
